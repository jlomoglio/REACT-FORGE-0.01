# REACT-FORGE-0.01
As a React Developer and a fan of VSCode, my goal was to build an editor strictly focused on React. It has a project driven approach, you start by creating your project and then selecting the npm packages you want added and it scaffolds your project and creates your repo. Has built in Notebook, simple GIT tools, etc.
